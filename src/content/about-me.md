## About This Site

I've always enjoyed web development and wanted to put together some blog to hold myself accountable to life but never had the motivation to do it. As a lover of trying a little bit of everything and after recently developing an allergy to gluten and dairy I had a fellow gf friend ask me for my thoughts on what was good and bad. After just 3 months of completely ghosting them on it I finally put together a fun little blog to track it.

Alongside my thoughts on various [Gluten Free](/reviews/gf-food) and [Dairy Free](/reviews/df-food) foods (though often both). I will also be ~~maybe~~ updating the site with my [Runs](/tracking/run/) and [Workouts](/tracking/workout) as I try to run a marathon and look good doing it. I will also hopefully begin to fill the [Blog](/blog) with lots of little articles on projects I throw together and random thoughts, but my ambitions for features to get out may be higher than my patience. At the least, the blog format will be a great way to capture this nonsense as it is made.

I have been hired at my first job :icon[mdi:celebration] which has been very exciting but very detrimental to my free time so updates may be sparing.

## About Me

I've been a lover of programming since 5th grade so for as long as I could remember it was the one track I could take. With few academic options pre-university, I mainly taught myself JavaScript and web development while learning what I needed when Python or C++ were a necessary part of a project.

When I started my Comp Sci degree at Mizzou I felt instantly more at home where I could spend a day learning C and then actually see if what I could do stacked up to expectations and peers. While certainly not all smooth sailing, I came out the other side with a Bachelors Degree majoring in Comp Sci and minoring in Math and Psych (two areas I held passion for but never saw myself getting a career in)

Immediately after graduating I had an internship at Veterans United Home Loans lined up that showed me how writing code outside of the classroom really works. While I cannot say that 4 months later I have figured it all out, I certainly feel like I have started to understand and work under this new modality. I have also been delighted to be hired full time as the company has an outstanding culture and I have yet to work with a team member I did not like (something I was certainly not expecting).
